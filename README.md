# Gazetteer Berlin/Brandenburg

A plug-in to search for addresses and cadastral data in Berlin/Brandenburg.

The results can be viewed on the map as geometry. The plug-in uses official and daily updated data (https://search.geobasis-bb.de/) from the State Office for Land Surveying and Geoinformation Brandenburg (LGB). It is free to use.


## Contents

The plug-in connects to the Search API of LGB. It includes a user interface that can be used to search for places, adresses or cadastral information (only Brandenburg). The results can be filtered and added to the map as layers. You can set the detail level of geometries (bounding box / complex) and style it. The geometries can also be used for further operations in qgis.
